      Hello! Welcome to my (abbreviated) portfolio. I am currently a
      PhD candidate at MIT in the department of mechanical engineering working on
      reactive metal power systems for ad hoc emergency electricity and
      desalination. My research generally focuses on how to make life better and more sustainable in
      the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-is-the-anthropocene-and-are-we-in-it-164801414/"
             target="_blank">anthropocene</a>.
      I am also a pianist, arranger, and composer based in
      Cambridge, MA and love to collaborate on all things science, art, and music! Feel free
      to reach out.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p align="justify">
      See my <a href="pages/cv.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>CV</strong></a> for detailed info and list of publications. 
      <br><br> 
      I began my academic career as a roboticist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where I worked on many things,
      including
      <a href="pages/yada.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>new software architecture for reconfigurable robotic systems</strong></a>, the <a href="pages/msr.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>
        Mars Sample Return Program</strong></a>, Mars 2020, and aluminum-powered Europa landers. I also helped drive <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/" target="_blank"><strong> this thing</strong></a> around.
      <br><br>
      Now at MIT, my research focuses on solving the problems that are caused by and contribute to climate change.
      I've actually been thinking 
      about these problems since I was in high school, when I worked on
      <a href="pages/carbonic_anhydrase_paper.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>carbon sequestration</strong></a> at Rutgers University.
      My latest project extracts energy from aluminum debris to power <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnNNdVaWq2U" target="_blank"><strong>emergency desalination</strong></a> and electricity generation.
      My work also digs into the thermodynamics and materials science of using aluminum-water reactions to generate
      <a href="http://meche.mit.edu/news-media/student-spotlight-peter-godart-15-sm-19-phd-candidate" target="_blank">
       <strong>hydrogen and heat from waste aluminum</strong></a>.
      Please find my most recent paper on this <a href="pages/aluminum_water_gibbs_accepted_preprint.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.

      <br><br>

      My work is currently supported by a J-WAFS Rasikbhai L. Meswani Fellowship for Water Solutions 
      (<a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-phd-students-awarded-j-wafs-fellowships-water-solutions-0617" target="_blank"><strong>press release</strong></a>), a Martin Family Society Fellowship for Sustainability, and the Hugh Hampton Young Fellowship.
      </p>

      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p align="justify">
      I co-teach <a href="http://esdd.mit.edu" target="_blank"><strong>2.013/2.014</strong></a> (Engineering Systems Design and Developement) at MIT with Prof. Doug Hart. 2.013/2.014 is a two-semester
      capstone design class for both undergrads and grad students in mechanical engineering. When I took the class in 2014-2015,
      we built a 3 kW hydrogen fuel cell power system that runs on recycled aluminum. Since I began teaching it, our students have
      built autonomous ship cleaning robots, tools for measuring soil nutrients and soil compaction, and an
      aluminum-powered BMW i3 to name a small few. Currently, students are developing a carbon-neutral cooling system to be
      integrated onto MIT's campus and an autonomous ocean platform capable of mapping the Earth's ionosphere to improve GPS
      accuracy.

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p align="justify">
      I recently wrote a 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh1ObU1R_PI&list=UUx8mAQROpy2eT8_DhRGKJkA" target="_blank"> <strong>big piece</strong></a> 
      for MIT's festival jazz ensemble and gospel choir.  In January 2019, I traveled with this same group to 
      <a href="http://mta.mit.edu/news/en-pie-de-lucha%E2%80%94mit-festival-jazz-ensemble-puerto-rico-0" target="_blank"><strong>Puerto Rico</strong></a> with Miguel Zenon to share and learn about music and science on the island (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vptYlSHEoAg&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video</a>).
      Also check out my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/funkyprojectile" target="_blank"><strong>SoundCloud</strong></a> and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ptgodart" target="_blank"><strong>YouTube</strong></a> channel for some of my past 
     projects. For my other music happenings, follow me on the 
     <a href="https://www.instagram.com/petergodart" target="_blank"> <strong>gram</strong></a>.

      <h2>Art</h2>
      <p align="justify">
      I also design and build random things that look and sound cool:<br>
      - <a href="pages/furniture_short.html"> <strong>custom furniture</strong></a><br>
      - <a href="pages/star.html"><strong>giant metal sculptures</strong></a><br>
      - <a href="pages/piano_installation.html"><strong>sound installations</strong></a><br>
      - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqhLZAZmCrM" target="_blank"><strong>midi-mechanical looper</strong></a> (converts midi to DXF files for gears)<br>
      - <a href="https://youtu.be/igpfqXKrSLc" target="_blank"><strong>trash instruments</strong></a><br>
      - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CftVVVHrZTk&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"><strong>electro-acoustic synthesizer</strong></a><br>
